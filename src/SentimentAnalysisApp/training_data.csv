# AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEWS - NEGATIVE
# ============================================================================

negative,I am extremely disappointed with this product as it stopped working completely after just three weeks of normal use which is utterly unacceptable
negative,The quality of this item is absolutely terrible and it feels incredibly cheap and flimsy like it was made from the lowest quality materials available
negative,I followed the instructions exactly as written but this device simply does not work properly and customer service has been completely unhelpful
negative,This is honestly the worst purchase I have made in years and I deeply regret not reading more of the negative reviews before buying it
negative,The product arrived damaged despite being advertised as new and the seller has refused to provide a refund or replacement which is completely unfair
negative,I am very frustrated with this laptop as it runs incredibly slowly and frequently crashes even when I am only performing basic tasks like browsing
negative,The battery life on this device is absolutely appalling and barely lasts two hours despite the manufacturer claiming it would last an entire day
negative,This vacuum cleaner is completely useless on carpets and just pushes the dirt around rather than actually picking it up which defeats the purpose
negative,I wasted my money on this kitchen gadget as it broke during the very first use and now I am stuck with something completely worthless
negative,The noise level on this appliance is unbearably loud and it sounds like a jet engine taking off every time I try to use it in my kitchen
negative,This product looks nothing like the pictures shown online and I feel completely misled by the false advertising and deceptive marketing tactics
negative,The assembly instructions were completely incomprehensible and several important parts were missing from the package which made it impossible to build
negative,I have tried multiple times to contact customer support about this defective item but nobody has responded to any of my emails or phone calls
negative,This charger stopped working after only one week and now it will not charge any of my devices no matter what I try to do to fix it
negative,The quality control on this product is clearly non existent as mine arrived with obvious scratches and dents all over the exterior surface
negative,I am thoroughly dissatisfied with this purchase as it performs far worse than my previous model which cost half the price and lasted years longer
negative,This smart device constantly disconnects from my WiFi network and the app crashes repeatedly making it virtually impossible to use as intended
negative,The material used for this item is extremely poor quality and started to fall apart and deteriorate after just a handful of uses which is ridiculous
negative,I specifically ordered this in black but received it in white instead and the returns process has been an absolute nightmare to deal with
negative,This tool is completely ineffective for its intended purpose and I honestly cannot understand how it received such positive reviews from other customers
negative,The product description was wildly inaccurate and the actual item I received was significantly smaller and cheaper looking than I was expecting
negative,I have owned this for less than a month and it has already developed multiple serious problems that make it essentially unusable at this point
negative,The customer service experience was absolutely dreadful with rude representatives who seemed completely uninterested in helping resolve my legitimate issues
negative,This is poorly designed and extremely uncomfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time which makes it completely impractical for daily use
negative,I feel completely ripped off by this purchase as the quality is atrocious and it is definitely not worth even half of what I paid for it
negative,The performance of this device is laughably bad and it struggles to complete even the simplest tasks that similar products handle with ease
negative,This product arrived three weeks late despite paying extra for expedited shipping and the company refused to refund the shipping charges
negative,I am incredibly frustrated that this item requires proprietary batteries that are expensive and difficult to find instead of using standard sizes
negative,The warranty process has been an absolute joke with the manufacturer denying my valid claim on ridiculous technicalities and unhelpful excuses
negative,This is terribly made with sharp edges and rough surfaces that feel dangerous to handle and nothing like the smooth finish shown in photos
negative,I have never been more disappointed with an online purchase and I will definitely be avoiding this brand entirely in the future without question
negative,The functionality promised in the marketing materials simply does not exist in the actual product which feels like blatant false advertising to me
negative,This broke within hours of opening the package and attempting to use it for the first time which suggests terrible quality control standards
negative,The software on this device is buggy and crashes constantly making it frustrating and unreliable for any serious work or important tasks
negative,I expected much better quality given the premium price point but what I received was cheap rubbish that belongs in a discount bargain bin
negative,This product is a complete waste of money and I wish I had simply bought the more expensive alternative from a reputable brand instead
negative,The build quality is so poor that pieces started falling off after minimal use and now it is held together with tape which is embarrassing
negative,I am shocked by how poorly this performs compared to the glowing reviews and I suspect many of those positive ratings must be fake or paid
negative,This item is far too complicated to use and the manual is virtually useless with vague instructions and missing information throughout
negative,The smell emanating from this product is absolutely horrendous and chemical like and has not dissipated even after weeks of airing it out

# ============================================================================
# AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEWS - NEUTRAL
# ============================================================================

neutral,This product does exactly what it claims to do but nothing more and I would say it represents reasonable value for the price I paid
neutral,The quality is acceptable for everyday use though I have noticed some minor issues that are not deal breakers but slightly annoying nevertheless
neutral,It works as advertised and gets the job done adequately but I was not particularly impressed by any specific features or performance aspects
neutral,This is a decent option if you are on a budget but if you can afford to spend a bit more I would recommend looking at other alternatives
neutral,The build quality is okay and it feels reasonably sturdy though I do have some concerns about how well it will hold up over extended use
neutral,I have mixed feelings about this purchase as some aspects are quite good whilst others are rather disappointing so it averages out to mediocre
neutral,This product is perfectly functional and serves its basic purpose but it lacks any standout features that would make me enthusiastic about recommending it
neutral,The performance is neither impressive nor terrible and it simply does what you would expect from a mid range product in this category
neutral,It arrived on time and works as described but the overall experience has been rather unremarkable and forgettable if I am being honest
neutral,The instructions could be clearer but with some patience I managed to figure it out and it now works acceptably well for my needs
neutral,This is an average product that will suffice for most people but those looking for premium quality should probably consider other options instead
neutral,The design is fairly basic and functional without being particularly attractive or innovative but it does the job it was designed for adequately
neutral,I would describe this as a solid middle of the road choice that neither excites nor disappoints and represents fair value for money spent
neutral,The features are limited compared to more expensive models but for casual users who do not need bells and whistles it should be sufficient
neutral,It takes a bit of getting used to and has a learning curve but once you understand how it works it performs its function reasonably well
neutral,This met my minimum requirements but did not exceed them in any meaningful way so I would say my expectations were met but not surpassed
neutral,The quality seems acceptable for the price point though I would not expect it to last as long as more expensive alternatives on the market
neutral,It works fine for my purposes but I can see how someone with more demanding needs might find it somewhat lacking in certain areas
neutral,This is a practical and sensible choice for basic everyday use but do not expect any premium features or exceptional performance from it
neutral,The product arrived as described and functions properly but there is nothing particularly special or noteworthy about it that stands out to me
neutral,I would say this represents decent value though the quality is not amazing and I have some minor reservations about its long term durability
neutral,It does the job adequately and I have no major complaints but I am not overwhelmingly satisfied either so it is a rather neutral experience overall
neutral,The performance is consistent and reliable if unspectacular and it handles basic tasks competently without any significant issues or problems
neutral,This is a reasonable purchase for someone who needs something functional without requiring top tier quality or cutting edge features in particular
neutral,The user interface is somewhat dated and could use improvement but once you get familiar with it the product works well enough for everyday tasks
neutral,I would categorise this as an acceptable budget option that makes some compromises on quality and features to achieve a lower price point
neutral,It functions as intended and I have not encountered any serious problems but I am also not particularly impressed by anything about it either
neutral,This is a standard product that delivers on its basic promises without offering anything extra or exceptional that would distinguish it from competitors
neutral,The quality is passable and it should last a reasonable amount of time with normal use though I would not expect it to be particularly durable long term
neutral,It serves its purpose adequately and represents fair value for what you pay but there are certainly better options available if you can spend more money

# RESTAURANT REVIEWS - NEGATIVE
# ============================================================================

negative,We waited over an hour for our food to arrive and when it finally came it was cold and completely different from what we had actually ordered
negative,The service at this restaurant was absolutely appalling with rude staff who seemed annoyed by our presence and made us feel completely unwelcome
negative,I found a hair in my main course which was disgusting and when I complained the manager was dismissive and offered no apology or compensation whatsoever
negative,The prices are extortionate for what you receive and the portion sizes were laughably small leaving us still hungry after spending a fortune
negative,This has to be the worst dining experience I have ever had with burnt food terrible service and an overall atmosphere that was depressing and uncomfortable
negative,The restaurant was filthy with dirty tables sticky menus and questionable hygiene standards that made me seriously concerned about food safety
negative,We booked a table weeks in advance but when we arrived they claimed to have no record of our reservation and refused to accommodate us despite being half empty
negative,The food was bland and completely lacking in flavour as if the kitchen had forgotten that seasoning exists and the presentation was sloppy and unappealing
negative,Our waiter was incredibly pushy trying to upsell expensive items and made us feel pressured throughout the entire meal which ruined the experience
negative,The noise level was unbearable with music so loud we could not hold a conversation and the tables were crammed so close together we had no privacy
negative,I specifically mentioned my severe nut allergy when ordering but my dish arrived containing nuts which could have been extremely dangerous for me
negative,The restaurant ran out of half the items on the menu which seems completely unacceptable for a supposedly upmarket establishment on a Saturday evening
negative,We were charged for items we never received and when we questioned the bill the staff became defensive and argumentative rather than apologetic
negative,The quality of the ingredients was clearly subpar with limp vegetables tough meat and everything tasted like it had been sitting under heat lamps for hours
negative,This place tries to be fancy but fails miserably with pretentious food descriptions that do not match the mediocre dishes that actually arrive at the table
negative,The booking system is a complete shambles and they had double booked our table meaning we had to wait forty minutes despite having a confirmed reservation
negative,The bathroom facilities were disgusting and completely unhygienic which speaks volumes about the overall standards and cleanliness of this establishment
negative,We were rushed through our meal with staff clearing plates before we had finished eating and bringing the bill before we had even requested it
negative,The wine I ordered was corked and off but the waiter insisted it was fine and refused to replace it which shows a complete lack of proper wine service knowledge
negative,I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone as the entire experience from start to finish was disappointing stressful and not worth the money spent at all
